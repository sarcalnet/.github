## [SARCalNet](https://www.sarcalnet.org)

To respond to the need of standardized cal/val practices and of a curated
network of reference data, the [SARCalNet](https://www.sarcalnet.org)
initiative was created within the
[CEOS WGCV SAR subgroup](https://calvalportal.ceos.org/sar_subgroup).

The [SARCalNet](https://www.sarcalnet.org) initiative aims to establish and
curate the SARCalNet database, which will allow for the consistent
dissemination of reliable and standardized information about SAR calibration
sites  and targets.

The initiative also aims at the documentation of requirements for calibration
targets and image analysis, which shall be provided to the broader SAR
community through the [SARCalNet](https://www.sarcalnet.org) library.
Those, together with the calibration sites database, sample datasets and tools
shall facilitate the harmonized use of multiple calibration sites and promote
cross-validation between different SAR systems.

This GitHub Organization has been created to host
[SARCalNet](https://www.sarcalnet.org) related projects and resources.
