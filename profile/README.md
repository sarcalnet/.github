## SARCalNet (https://www.sarcalnet.org)

This GitHub Organization hosts SARCalNet related projects and resources.

To respond to the need of standardized cal/val practices and of a curated
network of reference data, the SARCalNet initiative was created within the
[CEOS WGCV SAR subgroup](https://calvalportal.ceos.org/sar_subgroup).

The SARCalNet initiative aims to establish and curate the SARCalNet database,
which will allow for the consistent dissemination of reliable and standardized
information about SAR calibration sites  and targets.

The initiative also aims at the documentation of requirements for calibration
targets and image analysis, which shall be provided to the broader SAR
community through the SARCalNet library.
Those, together with the calibration sites database, sample datasets and tools
shall facilitate the harmonized use of multiple calibration sites and promote
cross-validation between different SAR systems.
